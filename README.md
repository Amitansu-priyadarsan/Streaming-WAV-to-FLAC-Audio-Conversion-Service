## Features

- üé∂ **Real-time Audio Conversion**: Streams WAV audio data and converts it to FLAC format on-the-fly.
- ‚ö° **WebSocket Communication**: Uses WebSocket for real-time data transmission.
- ‚ùó **Error Handling**: Enhanced error handling during audio processing and streaming.
- ‚úÖ **Comprehensive Testing**: Includes unit and integration tests to validate functionality.
- üìä **Load Testing**: Supports performance testing using k6.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.16 or higher
- Docker (optional for containerization)
- WebSocket library (`github.com/gorilla/websocket`)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/wav-to-flac-converter.git
   cd wav-to-flac-converter

2.Install dependencies:
```bash
   go mod tidy
   ```
3.Run the service:
```bash
   go run main.go

   ```

4.The server will start listening on localhost:3000. Ensure you have a WAV file to test the service.

## Client
To demonstrate functionality, use the provided client.go to send a WAV file and receive the converted FLAC file.

1.Place a WAV file named sample.wav in the same directory as client.go.

2.Run the client:
```bash
go run client.go
```
3.The output FLAC file will be saved as output.flac.

## API Endpoints

### WebSocket Endpoint
- **URL**: `/ws`
- **Method**: `POST`
- **Description**: Accepts a WAV audio stream and returns the converted FLAC audio stream.

#### Request
- **Content-Type**: `application/octet-stream`
- **Body**: WAV audio data in binary format.

###Response
- Content-Type: audio/flac
- Body: FLAC audio data

## Testing
Unit Testing
To run unit tests for the WAV to FLAC conversion logic, execute the following command:
```bash
go test ./tests/...
```
## Integration Testing
To validate WebSocket connections and streaming capabilities, run:
```bash
go test ./tests/integration_test.go
```
## Load Testing with k6
To perform load testing on the WebSocket endpoint, use the provided loadtest.js script.

Install k6 if you haven't already:
```bash
brew install k6
```
Run the load test:
```bash
k6 run loadtest.js
```
Output will look like -
```bash
data_received.........: 0 B  0 B/s
     data_sent.............: 0 B  0 B/s
     iteration_duration....: avg=1s       min=1s      med=1s       max=1s     p(90)=1s     p(95)=1s

```


## Performance Considerations
- ‚è±Ô∏è Low-Latency Processing: The service is optimized for minimal delay during audio processing.
- üìà Scalability: Can be deployed in a containerized environment (e.g., Kubernetes) to handle high traffic loads.
- üö® Error Handling: The system is designed to gracefully handle errors during streaming and conversion processes.

## Conclusion
The WAV to FLAC Audio Conversion Service is a scalable and efficient backend solution for real-time audio processing. Comprehensive documentation, testing strategies, and performance optimizations ensure a reliable service that meets the needs of audio streaming applications.
